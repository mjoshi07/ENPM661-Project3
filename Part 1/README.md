# Part 1
A* path planning with non-holonomic constraints

Given a start and goal location, plan a path using A* algorithm

## Run instructions
```
python main.py
```
* Run the above command and follow the on-screen instructions
* The program asks the following inputs from the user:
* `clearance`
* `rpm1`
* `rpm2`
* `start x`
* `start y`
* `start theta`
* `goal x`
* `goal y`
* After this A* algorithms finds the shortest path and visualization is performed after search is complete

* Other parameters, like robot wheel radius, robot wheel base length, map size are all defined in `Config.py`
