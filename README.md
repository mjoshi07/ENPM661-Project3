# ENPM661-Project3

A* path planning with non-holonomic constraints

Given a start position (x, y, theta) and a goal position(x, y), plan a path using A* algorithm while taking into account the robot's non-holonomic constraints like left and right wheel velocity, robot wheel radius, robot wheel base length, clearance from obstacles

## Dependencies
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* ROS (noetic)
* Moveit
* TurtleBot3
